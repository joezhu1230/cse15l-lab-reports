- The error we saw when the test failed![Screenshot 2022-04-24 144039](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103288060/164997845-cfb2254a-bca8-42a8-b8fe-0eadd1e7b344.png)
- The bug was caused by the markdown file not being able to recongnize the correct file inputs that we are trying to test. 
The symptom was the code did not give the correct output. The bug that we ran into was that the output did not contain "[]" and "()".  
We had to write these lines of code to make sure that the file would give the lines that contain "[]" and "()". 
After we added the lines, the output matched what we expected and it was correct.

-The symptom was the code did not give the correct output. The bug that we ran into was that the input did not contain "[]" and "()" in which the 
code did not behave correctly.
We had to write these lines of code to make sure that code would read the input correctly, more specifically the ones 
that contained "[]" and "()".
After we added the lines, the output matched what we expected and it was correct.

- The symptom was the file did not run correctly and gave the ouput shown above.
The bug why this error was caused is becasue we did not define which file for the main method to test. Once we added the name of the file
that we wanted to use for test, the issue was resolved and the tests successfully ran.
